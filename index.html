This service mimm<a href="./noti#Uj15U">>ckys the "multi-url-redirect' of Niall Bunting</a> who I thank very much for 
having such a perfect name, to tell "the <a href="./em#xc9sR">N of What if God were one of u</a>s?"" that we'<a href="./noti#JEqrs".html">re *bunting* agai</a>n.  You can pass it a list of URL's separated by commas, either prepended by the "#" hash sign that I use or his "url-multi-redirect?a=".  It also accepts Base64 encoded strings that are separate by commas, or a single block of Base64 that decodes to a string of commas.  It returns the shortened URL postpending the forwarded URL.
